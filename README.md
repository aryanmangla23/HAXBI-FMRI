# HAXBI-FMRI

### fMRI Decoding with the Haxby Dataset

This project demonstrates multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) on fMRI data using the Haxby 2001 dataset. The goal is to decode visual stimulus categories (`face` vs. `house`) from brain activity patterns in the ventral temporal cortex using machine learning techniques. In addition to classification, I explored spatial localization of information using searchlight analysis and analyze the representational structure of neural patterns using Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA).
