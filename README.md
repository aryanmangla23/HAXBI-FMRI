# HAXBI-FMRI

### fMRI Decoding with the Haxby Dataset

This project applies **multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA)** techniques to functional MRI (fMRI) data from the Haxby et al., 2001 dataset. The goal is to classify visual stimuli (e.g., faces vs. houses) based on distributed patterns of brain activity, and to understand how and where the brain encodes this information.
